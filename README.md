# BodyMap_RNAseq
---

This repository exists to document my ongoing experience of mapping Illumina BodyMap RNAseq data to the human genome.

To give context about the order of the notebooks:

The Jupyter notebooks files (.ipynb extension) are the definitive format; the .html alternatives are merely provided if the notebooks don’t render properly.

The BodyMap\_Learning_Notebook represents my disorganized but thorough notes about things I learned in the course of the project.  They’re only recommended reading if someone wants to see how messy my head can be.

The BodyMap\_RNAseq_local notebook represents a cleaned-up version in which I attempt to run a trial dataset on a laptop.

The BodyMap_Galaxy notebook is my (ongoing) attempt to best leverage the Galaxy NGS server & architecture to execute the read mapping.
